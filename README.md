## Overview
Here I got a jpeg file as I am a free subscriber so I did not get the design file. My task is to the Order Summary Card as close as the picture I am provided. It can be done by HTML and CSS. 

### The challenge
I completed the basic code easily but I wanted to improve the system. For example: now when you open mutiple question, both of the answers will beopened but I wanted to make like when I click the question the answer will be revealed and when I click the other question then previous answer will be hidden and only clicked question will be visible. I spent my 75% time in this and I succeeded eventuallay but there another problem appeared so I commented the code and uploading the basic solution. I will again try this. And another problem I left is that I wanted a smooth animation when I click the question. Animation on the arrow worked but answer portion didn't work. I will solve this too.

Users should be able to:
- a Normal state where the design will be same.
- And also see hover states for interactive elements
- When click anywhere in the question, the answer will be visible.

## My process
At first, I designed the entire layout in Adobe XD and it took me only 30 minutes. Then I jumped in my Visual Studio Code and after completing HTML and CSS I started Javascript.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS
- Vanilla Javascript



### Continued development

I will work with transition effect in the solution. And also refactor the html code. And of course I will complete my work in Javascript section.
